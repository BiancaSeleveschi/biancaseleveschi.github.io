    content: |-

      Passionate about personal growth and making a positive impact, I envision myself as a small but determined entity within the vast ocean of individuals dedicated to improving lives. Although my initial inclination led me toward the field of medicine, I discovered a lingering sense of unfulfillment. It was during this period of introspection that I turned my attention toward my brother, a programmer, and began to explore the fascinating world he was immersed in. Eager to understand the intricacies of programming, I eagerly sought his guidance, posing countless questions and diving deep into the subject matter.
      
      Summoning the courage to step out of my comfort zone, I abandoned my previous job and ventured into the world of programming. Fueling my curiosity, I enrolled in a comprehensive programming course, eager to acquire new knowledge and skills.
      
      Following the programming course, I am more motivated and determined than ever. I stand resolute and fully committed to my journey in front-end programming. Each step I take is driven by my determination to grow, learn, and make a meaningful impact in this ever-evolving field.
