      I'm only one more drop in this ocean of people, trying to get better, evolve and do or, at least, try to make other people's lives better. I know we can do good to people in so many ways, but with the help of technology I think we can greatly facilitate people's lives.
      
      Following the programming course, I am more motivated and determined than ever. I want to invest in myself and the company I will work for, not to remain only at the stage of passion, but to become a professional.
