    title: "About Me"

    content: |-

      After finishing high school, I thought pursuing a career in medicine was the safest choice. I spent some time in this profession, but I found my role lacked the mental stimulation I wanted. It simply did not feel right.

      Meanwhile, I had always been interested in technology. Even though many people told me it wasn't a good field for women, I couldn't help being curious.
      
      The change happened when my brother decided to become a programmer. Watching his focus and excitement for every task made me feel the same way. I saw his first steps into a programming career and I wanted to follow that path too.
      
      That was the moment where I decided to start my own programming journey!
      
      I recall the countless nights solving algorithmic problems in code, it was so thrilling. The technical curiosity I had, held me captive to solve “just one more problem”. Time seemed to slip away unnoticed.
      
      Looking back, I can see the journey was full of engaging challenges and a lot of work. However, it brought me immense joy and fulfillment. I'm glad I made the choice to switch paths when I did.
      
      How did I navigate this transformative journey?
      
      I signed up for an intensive programming course. I believe this was one of the best decisions of my life. The course was well-structured and helped me understand the field better. I spent over 400 hours solving problems, which improved my programming skills.
      
      I also worked on many projects. This gave me hands-on experience with programming languages like JavaScript and Vue.js. I learned how the front end of software applications works. This experience built a strong foundation in programming principles and problem-solving.
